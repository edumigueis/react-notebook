This project consists of a SPA where notes are shown and edited. Each note can be created, edited, deleted and customized. All the data in the app is available during execution and is not saved, but feel free to integrate it with an API or a file saver. All notes are stored in an array in the highest state of the app, and to save this data, I recommend you change the CRUD methods in App.js to make them save everything elsewhere.
